# stackFetch

*Shazam your code into your text editor in real time with this package for Atom!*  Type a word and highlight, then activate stackFetch to find and import code snippets from stack overflow on command. No need to specify language, stackFetch detects it automatically and searches only in that language.

Under the hood, we are making two http requests asynchronously using apm dependency modules, **Google** and NPM **Request**, together with promises. We search Google for _Stack Overflow_-specific content related to your highlighted search term, choose the number #1 result on Google, and import code snippets from the accepted answer on that page.
